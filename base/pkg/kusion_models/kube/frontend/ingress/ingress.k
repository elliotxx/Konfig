schema Ingress(common.Metadata):
    """Ingress is a collection of rules that allow inbound connections to reach the endpoints defined by a backend. 
    An Ingress can be configured to give services externally-reachable urls, load balance traffic, terminate SSL, offer name based virtual hosting etc.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name: str
        The name of the resource.
        Name must be unique within a namespace. It's required when creating
        resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the
        generation of an appropriate name automatically.
        Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration
        definition. Cannot be updated. More info:
        http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
        Required.
    labels: {str:str}
        Labels is a map of string keys and values that can be used to
        organize and categorize (scope and select) objects.
        May match selectors of replication controllers and services.
        More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels
        Optional.
    annotations: {str:str}
        Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a
        resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve
        arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved
        when modifying objects.
        More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
        Optional.
    namespace: str
        Namespaces are intended for use in environments with many users spread
        across multiple teams, or projects.
        For clusters with a few to tens of users, you should not need to create
        or think about namespaces at all. Start using namespaces when you need the features they provide.
        More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/
        Optional.
    rules: [networking_v1beta1.IngressRule]
        A list of host rules used to configure the Ingress. If unspecified, or no rule matches, all traffic is sent to the default backend.
